# Portable pstack runtime contract

This file defines the host-neutral binding for imported pstack skills. Read it before any child launch, model choice, transcript lookup, question, or long-running loop.

## Host selection

Use capabilities that the current host exposes. Do not assume Cursor, Pi, OMP, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, or one model provider.

If a capability is absent, preserve the workflow gate and report the limitation. Do not claim that a child, review, transcript, or live check occurred without host evidence.

## Two independent role systems

Model roles and execution roles are independent.

A pstack model role is one original configuration line, such as `bug-fix`, `how explorer`, or `interrogate reviewers`. It selects the model for one workflow step. A panel model role selects one model per child.

An execution role selects child behavior. It defines the prompt, tools, permissions, context policy, write authority, and lifecycle protocol.

Never convert pstack model roles into a small set of host agent model defaults. Several model roles can use the same execution role with different models. One panel can use the same execution role several times with one model per entry.

## Execution roles

| Execution role | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `explorer` | Read-only repository reconnaissance and trace reduction. |
| `watcher` | Observe one exact state transition, then terminate. |
| `planner` | Technical architecture, decomposition, and sequence design. |
| `designer` | Product, interaction, or alternative design work. |
| `reviewer` | Independent code, protocol, behavior, or security review. |
| `researcher` | Source-verified external documentation and API research. |
| `synthesizer` | Adjudicate frozen reports without changing their evidence. |
| `implementer` | Bounded implementation or test changes with explicit ownership. |
| `owner` | One coupled implementation session retained through its lifecycle. |
| `mechanical` | Fully specified low-judgment edits. |

Map execution roles to live host agents. Agent selection does not select a model.

For Pi with `pi-subagents`, use this default behavior map when those agents exist:

| Execution role | Pi agent |
| --- | --- |
| `explorer`, `watcher` | `scout` |
| `planner`, `designer`, `synthesizer` | `oracle` |
| `reviewer` | `reviewer` |
| `researcher` | `researcher` |
| `implementer`, `mechanical` | `worker` |
| `owner` | `delegate` |

Other hosts use their live agent names. The live inventory wins.

Every child brief must stand alone. It must name the goal, execution role, writable scope, acceptance criteria, verification command, forbidden scope, and report format.

## Model role configuration

Read `$PSTACK_CONFIG` when the variable is set. Otherwise, read `.pstack/config.md` from the current project. The environment path replaces the project path.

The left side of each line is a pstack model role. The right side is a concrete child model choice or a panel list.

Expand the two shared upstream labels exactly:

- `feature, refactoring` configures `feature` and `refactoring`.
- `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` configures `reflect judgment`, `reflect divergent`, and `reflect synthesizer`.

For Pi, concrete choices use `provider/model-id` with an optional thinking suffix. Add `[fast]` after supported explicit choices:

```text
openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol:max
openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna:xhigh [fast]
anthropic/claude-fable-5:medium
```

For another host, use the exact model value accepted by its child facility.

Resolve the exact model role named by the active workflow. Do not substitute an execution role name as the configuration key.

On Pi, call `pstack_launch` for one child. Call `pstack_panel` for all configured entries in one panel role. Call `pstack_followup` to continue a completed owner. Call `pstack_status` after the wait.

The deterministic router validates the complete configuration against the live model inventory. It maps the execution role to a Pi agent separately.

The router passes `provider/model-id:thinking` through the per-run `model` field. It passes `[fast]` through the separate `fast: true` field. A provider account can reject priority service. Treat that response as a child failure.

The router resolves `inherit-parent` and `auto` to the concrete parent model and thinking level. This preserves parent thinking without an agent default.

If a model role is absent, stop the Pi dispatch. If a concrete model is unavailable, stop the Pi dispatch. Do not use an agent default.

For a panel, the router launches one child per configured entry. `pstack_panel` uses one shared execution role and one Pi agent.

The router records requested route data in a custom session entry. It records observed child data after the asynchronous run completes.

Treat the direct `pi-subagents` completion as provisional. Call `pstack_status` before acceptance. Require true success and empty failure lists.

If an observed model or thinking level differs, reject that result as a routing failure. Do not count an implicit fallback.

The pstack setup does not modify host agent settings. User-owned host overrides can still control tools, skills, permissions, context, and fallback policy. A concrete per-run `model` remains the pstack model contract.

## Model delegation capability

Model inventory is not model delegation. A host can list models without a child facility that accepts a model choice.

Native Pi does not include subagents. Install `pi-subagents` version 0.57.0 or later for parallel children and per-run models:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents
```

Restart Pi. Run `/subagents-doctor`, then run `/pstack-doctor`. Continue only when both checks pass.

The pstack package registers `pstack_launch`, `pstack_panel`, `pstack_followup`, and `pstack_status`. These tools use the structured `pi-subagents` RPC bridge. They do not scrape transcripts or invoke private APIs.

Use `/pstack-routes` to inspect the latest route ledger entries in the current Pi session.

If the host cannot select a model for each child, report the capability gap. Do not write or claim an active pstack model configuration.

## Questions and interaction

Use the host's structured interaction tool when it exists. Otherwise ask one focused question in conversation.

Put observable facts in probes and verification runs. Do not ask the user for facts that the host can inspect.

## Skills and paths

Invoke skills through the host-supported skill mechanism. Resolve sibling files under `skills/<name>/` within this package.

OpenCode loads Agent Skills from `.opencode/skills/` in a project or `~/.config/opencode/skills/` globally. Copy this package's `skills/` contents into one of those locations.

OpenCode uses its native child facility. Pass pstack model choices per child through that facility. Do not apply Pi settings to OpenCode.

## Transcripts and history

Use the active host history resource or an explicit transcript directory. Use `$PSTACK_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR` when the host lacks a history resource.

Never scan unrelated workspaces or a global private transcript tree. If no transcript source exists, report the gap and continue only with evidence that does not require it.

## Long-running work and verification

Use the host's durable goal, watcher, or loop facility when available. Otherwise keep the predicate and checkpoint in a project-local decision trail.

Re-arm a watcher after every state change. Reject stale generations.

The root coordinator owns user interaction, approvals, integration, and final verification. A child report is evidence, not proof.
