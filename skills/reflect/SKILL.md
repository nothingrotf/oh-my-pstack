# Reflect

Follow the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md) for transcript discovery, execution roles, model roles, tool access, questions, and skill authoring.

`reflect judgment`, `reflect tooling`, `reflect divergent`, and `reflect synthesizer` are pstack model roles. On Pi, route each child through `pstack_launch`. The router binds each configured per-run `model`.

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

- The user said "reflect" or "/reflect".
- A complex task (5+ tool calls) just landed cleanly and the recipe is worth keeping.
- The agent hit dead ends, found the working path, and the path generalizes.
- The user corrected the agent's approach mid-task.
- A non-trivial workflow emerged that isn't captured anywhere.

Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent resolves its own transcript before fanning out. Use the host's active history resource, an explicit transcript directory, or `$PSTACK_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR`, in that order. Never scan another workspace or a global vendor history tree. If no transcript resolves, write a tight digest of the session and use that instead.

```bash
ls -t <agent-transcripts>/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Three transcript layouts: legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`).

For each candidate, read the first JSONL line and check that `message.content[0].text` contains the conversation's opening user prompt. Take the matching path. If no path resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

Launch three reviewer children before awaiting results. Resolve one model role per lens. On Pi, call `pstack_launch` three times with execution role `reviewer`. Grant each child read access to the transcript and required tools. Forbid file writes in the brief.

| Lens | Model role | Execution role | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment` | `reviewer` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `researcher` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect divergent` | `designer` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in their child reports.

### 3. Synthesize

Launch one child with execution role `synthesizer`. On Pi, call `pstack_launch` with model role `reflect synthesizer`. Give the child the tools required to verify citations. Forbid repository writes. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim with each reviewer output inserted where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. The synthesizer already applies this criterion; this is a final pass before edits land. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org; do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Those are tracker submissions, not skill edits. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): use the host's skill-authoring facility when available and run its draft / test / iterate loop; otherwise apply that loop directly.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): use the host's skill-authoring facility when available, or directly run the same description-review loop.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: use the host's skill-authoring facility when available, or author it directly from package conventions. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
